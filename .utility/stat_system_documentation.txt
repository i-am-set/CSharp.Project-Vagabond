CRPG STAT SYSTEM DESIGN REFERENCE
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

OVERVIEW
This is a living design reference for a five-stat CRPG system. Copy, paste, and expand as your project evolves.

STATS
Each character has five core attributes:

1. Strength (STR)
   • Raw physical power
   • Influences: melee damage, carry capacity, obstacle-breaking
   • Example:
     HeavyAttackDamage = BaseWeaponDamage * (1 + STR/100)

2. Agility (AGI)
   • Speed, reflexes, coordination
   • Influences: attack speed, dodge chance, stealth, ranged accuracy
   • Example:
     DodgeChance = AGI / (AGI + EnemyAccuracy)

3. Tenacity (TEN)
   • Endurance, resilience, grit
   • Influences: hit points, bleed/poison resistance, CC reduction
   • Example:
     CC_DurationMultiplier = 1 - (TEN / 200)

4. Intelligence (INT)
   • Mental acuity, learning, magical aptitude
   • Influences: spell power, mana/energy pool, skill XP gain
   • Example:
     SpellPower = BaseSpellPower * (1 + INT/120)

5. Charm (CHR)
   • Social skill, charisma, presence
   • Influences: dialogue options, prices, faction reputation
   • Example:
     PriceModifier = 1 - (CHR / 200)

DERIVED ATTRIBUTES

// Health & Energy, capped at 140 late-game ceiling
BaseHP            = 1
HealthPerTEN      = TEN/2
EquipmentHPBonus  = sum of all HP bonuses from gear

MaxHP             = min( (STR/2) + (TEN*2) + ((LVL / 2) * (TEN / 2)) + EquipmentHPBonus, 48 )

BaseEP            = 5
EnergyPerAGI      = AGI/2
EquipmentEPBonus  = sum of all EP bonuses from gear

MaxEP             = min( baseEP + Floor(AGI/2), 48 )

// Other derived
Accuracy          = (AGI * 0.8) + (INT * 0.2)
Evasion           = AGI + (TEN / 2)
CritChance        = (AGI / 150) + (STR / 300)
ManaRegenRate     = INT / 50
StaminaPool       = TEN / 2

SKILL CHECKS & DIFFICULTY
SkillRoll         = Stat + SkillLevel + RNG(1–20)
DifficultyThresholds:
  Easy     = 10
  Moderate = 15
  Hard     = 20
  VeryHard = 25+

COMBAT INTERACTIONS
TurnOrder         = sort by AGI (tie → random)
BaseAP            = 100
ActionAPCost      = varies per action (e.g. sprint=30, heavy swing=40)
APCostModifier    = 1 - (AGI / 200)
FinalAPCost       = ActionAPCost * APCostModifier
DamageReduction   = TEN * 0.1

PROGRESSION & GROWTH
OnLevelUp:
  • Grant 3–5 stat points OR
  • Choose a predefined build (Brute, Rogue, Mage, Diplomat, Tank)
StatSoftCap:
  • Above 50 in any stat → each additional point yields 0.75× benefit
TemporaryBuffs:
  • Potions/spells/equipment can grant +X to stats for limited time

GEAR & EQUIPMENT
StatRequirements:
  • Weapon/armor may require minimum STR or AGI
StatBonuses:
  • Gear can add flat or % bonuses to any core stat
SetEffects:
  • Full set bonuses (e.g. +10 CHR, +5% XP gain)

NPC & FACTION SYSTEMS
Reputation:
  • Modified by CHR during interactions
Companions:
  • Have their own stats; assist in checks
FactionRanks:
  • Unlockable via CHR-based persuasion or quest lines

LOOT & TREASURE
QualityTiers:
  • Common → Legendary influences stat bonuses
RandomizedStats:
  • Loot may roll extra bonuses to any core stat

EXTENSIONS & FUTURE IDEAS
• New stats: Luck, Perception, Willpower
• Sub-stats: ThrowingAccuracy (from AGI), SpellResistance (TEN+INT)
• Specializations: passive abilities at stat thresholds (e.g. IronGrip @ STR≥30)
• Synergies: combine stats for unique buffs (e.g. Fortitude = STR+TEN)
• DynamicScaling: enemy levels adjust to player’s average stat level

NOTES
• Keep all balance formulas in a separate spreadsheet.
• Log every formula change in a changelog.
• Play-test frequently to catch balance issues early.
